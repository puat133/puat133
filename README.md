- 👋 Hi, I’m @puat133
- 👀 I’m interested in doing research on stochastic filtering (projection filters, particle filters, etc) and quantum filtering and control.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning differential geometry and information geometry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projection filters, nonlinear control (especially Koopman operator based), and quantum filtering and control.
- 📫 How to reach me muhammad.emzir@kfupm.edu.sa
